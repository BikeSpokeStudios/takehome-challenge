# Take Home Challenge  

This is my solution to a take home challenge I was asked to complete. I was provided a screenshot and asked to replicate the design using the CSS Vanilla Framework.

### Technologies Used

* [Vanilla Framework](https://vanillaframework.io/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Wordpress API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/)

The Vanilla framework is an alternative to Bootstrap that allows for rapid prototyping and creating good-looking websites. It employs some nice typefaces.

I pulled data from the Wordpress API to get three blog posts. I then styled them using Vanilla's provided class names. I had to write a small amount of CSS to achieve the design. The Card class in Vanilla doesn't have the coloured strip across the top but the Notification class does, so I made my cards a hybrid of the two types and wrote two lines of CSS to fix some of the styles.
